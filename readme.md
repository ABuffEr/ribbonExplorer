* NVDA compatibility: 2017.3 and beyond

A NVDA add-on to enhance experience with Ribbon menu. Only in Office products, for the moment.

I hate - strongly, deeply hate - Ribbon menu. So, I sincerely hope you can find this add-on useful.

Important things to consider:

1. this add-on is in development;
2. confirmed (by users) to work on Microsoft Office 2019, 365 and 2021;
3. compatibility for old NVDA/Office versions is not guaranteed.

## Usage

Simply install, open an Office application, press Alt to access Ribbon, and familiarize with new menu layout.

You can use arrows, tab, enter, esc, quite like in a normal menu. Alt+down/upArrow are supported too, for expanding some controls.

If there are problems (please report), or you want temporarily interact without add-on assistance, press NVDA+space.

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
