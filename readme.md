# RibbonExplorer

* Author: Alberto Buffolino
* Download [development version][dev]
* NVDA compatibility: 2017.3 and beyond

A NVDA add-on to enhance experience with Ribbon menu. Only in Office products, for the moment.

I hate - strongly, deeply hate - Ribbon menu. So, I sincerely hope you can find this add-on useful.

Important things to consider:

1. this add-on is in development;
2. tested/developed on Microsoft Office version 16.0.*;
3. compatibility for old NVDA/Office versions is not guaranteed.

## Usage

Simply install, press Alt to open menu, and familiarize with new menu layout.

You can use arrows, tab, esc, quite like in a normal menu.

If there are problems, or you want temporarily interact without add-on assistance, press NVDA+space.

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
